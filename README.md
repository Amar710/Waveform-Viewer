# Waveform-Viewer

The Waveform Viewer is a Java-based application designed to read, process, and display the waveform of 
stereo .WAV audio files. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to select and 
visualize audio data in a waveform format, offering insights into the audio's properties, such as entropy 
and average Huffman code length.
